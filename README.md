Prompt Less, Do More: Build an AI Agent That Lands the Job (And More)

The age of static prompt-response language models is evolving into something far more powerful—AI agents. These agents don’t just answer questions; they act with purpose, reason through complexity, and interact with their environment to solve real-world problems. This talk is a hands-on introduction to the exciting world of AI agents—what they are, why they matter, and how they’re reshaping our interaction with AI.

We’ll dive into the core architecture of AI agents, explore what sets them apart from traditional LLM use, and demystify how to build them using open-source frameworks and the Model Context Protocol (MCP)—a powerful emerging standard for enabling multi-step, tool-using, context-aware agents.
To ground these ideas in something tangible, we’ll walk through a live demo of an AI agent built to assist with job searches. Imagine the frustration of endlessly refining resumes, scouring job descriptions, and manually preparing interview questions. Now envision an AI agent automating this entire process - intelligently matching your skills to opportunities, generating tailored interview questions, and offering strategic preparation guidance. This hands-on example demonstrates the practical power of agents—and opens the door to possibilities across recruiting, research, healthcare, and education.
